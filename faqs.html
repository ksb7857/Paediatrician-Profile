    <summary class="qa-question">What is the difference between a food allergy and an intolerance?</summary>
        <p>'Allergy' typically refers to reactions that occur soon (e.g. <1 hour) after ingesting a food which involve immune molecules called <strong>IgE</strong>. Symptoms vary but can include hives, lip swelling and vomiting. The most severe type of 'IgE allergy' is called anaphylaxis. 
            <p>Other parts of the immune system can cause delayed reactions, sometimes called non-IgE allergies. Examples include coeliac disease and cow's milk protein "intolerance/allergy", both of which can cause delayed gastrointestinal symptoms. Non-IgE allergies do not cause immediate reactions like hives or anaphylaxis.</p>
            <p>Reactions that don't involve the immune system at all are not allergies and are sometimes called intolerances e.g. lactose intolerance, which occurs when there is not enough of a particular enzyme (lactase) in the gut. </p>
            For more detail about different types of reactions to foods, refer to this ASCIA page.

    <summary class="qa-question">If my baby has mucus or blood in their nappies does that mean they have an allergy?</summary>
        <p>Small amounts of mucus in the stool in a well infant is normal. This mucus may be produced by healthy gut bacteria and may play a role in helping stool pass smoothly. 
            Large amounts of mucus and/or any blood in the nappies is not normal and other causes must be considered, such as infection. Mucusy stool with fresh blood in an otherwise thriving infant is commonly due to a delayed non-IgE reaction to a food protein (often cow's milk). Other less common causes should also be considered and a thorough assessment by a GP or paediatrician is always warranted.</p>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">What is lactose intolerance and why does it occur?</summary>
      <p>Lactose is a sugar found in milk (including breastmilk and cow's milk), and its digestion involves an enzyme called lactase. Lactose intolerance occurs when there is not enough of the lactase enzyme in the gut, leading to symptoms such as tummy pain, bloating and diarrhoea. 
In infants and young children, lactose intolerance is usually a temporary phenomenon seen after a viral illness like gastroenteritis, and usually resolves within weeks. Permanent lactose intolerance in infants is extremely rare. In adults and older children, lactose intolerance usually occurs when there is not enough lactase enzyme in the gut to handle the amount of lactose (from dairy) that is consumed. This can often be managed by cutting down on lactose intake. </p>

      <details>
       <summary class="qa-question">How are allergies diagnosed?</summary>
<p>The most important part of allergy diagnosis is the history, i.e. the description of symptoms and their potential relationship to an allergy-causing substance (allergen). The most common test used to             confirm a suspected allergy is a skin prick test, which an be carried out during a consultation.</p> 
        <p>Interpreting a skin prick test is not straightforward, since 'false positives' are common, e.g. the test may be positive to a food that the person regularly consumes without having any allergy symptoms and is         not actually "allergic to". It is generally not recommended to carry out skin prick tests for foods that have never been consumed, though there are exceptions to this rule. Blood tests can also be conducted for                 specific allergens. Both of these tests can only be used for immediate (IgE) allergies. Food challenges involve giving increasing quantities of a food under close medical supervision to observe for a reaction.                 These may be done for several reasons, including to confirm if a child has outgrown an allergy. Food challenges can be arranged if required at North Shore Private Hospital.</p>
                <p>For detailed information on allergy testing, including specialised tests not mentioned above, read <a href="https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/allergy-testing/allergy-testing">this ASCIA page.</p>
