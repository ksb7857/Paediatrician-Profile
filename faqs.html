      <summary class="qa-question">What is the difference between a food allergy and an intolerance?</summary>
      <div class="qa-answer">
          <p>Terminology about food reactions can be confusing, since reactions with very different causes can be referred to using the same words. The most common types of reactions are:
          <ul><li><strong>Immediate</strong> allergic reactions, which occur within minutes-to-hours after eating a food and involve an immune molecule called "IgE". Symptoms vary and can include hives, vomiting, or lip swelling. Anaphylaxis is the most severe type of immediate reaction. These IgE reactions are sometimes called "true allergy".
              <li><strong>Delayed</strong> allergic reactions, which begin hours-to-days after eating a food and which involve other parts of the immune system, not IgE. An example is coeliac disease, which can cause gastrointestinal symptoms, however there are many types of delayed allergic reactions which can affect other parts of the body including skin and joints.</li>
              <li><strong>Intolerances</strong>, which occur if there is a problem digesting a food, and which do not involve the immune system at all and are therefore not allergies. An example is lactose intolerance, which happens when there is not enough of a particular enzyme (lactase) in the gut. Allergy testing is not useful for intolerances</li>
          </ul>
          <p>For more detail about different types of reactions to foods, refer to <a href="https://www.allergy.org.au/patients/food-other-adverse-reactions/food-intolerance">this ASCIA page</a>.</p>

    <summary class="qa-question">If my baby has mucus or blood in their nappies does that mean they have an allergy?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Small amounts of mucus in the stool in a well infant is normal. This mucus may be produced by healthy gut bacteria and may play a role in helping stool pass smoothly.</p> 
            <p>Large amounts of mucus and/or any blood in the nappies is not normal and other causes must be considered, such as infection. Mucusy stool with fresh blood in an otherwise thriving infant is commonly due to a delayed 'non-IgE' reaction to a food protein (often cow's milk). Other less common causes should also be considered and a thorough assessment by a GP or paediatrician is always warranted.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">What is lactose intolerance and do babies get it?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Lactose is a sugar found in milk (including breastmilk and cow's milk), and its digestion involves an enzyme called lactase. Lactose intolerance occurs when there is not enough of the lactase enzyme in the gut, leading to symptoms such as tummy pain, bloating and diarrhoea.</p> 
<p>In infants and young children, lactose intolerance is usually a <strong>temporary</strong>problem after a viral illness like gastroenteritis, and it resolves within weeks. It is extremely rare for babies to be born with lactose intolerance, and much more common for it to develop in older children and adults.</p>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">How are allergies diagnosed?</summary>
      <div class="qa-answer">
          <p>The most important part of allergy diagnosis is the history, i.e. the description of symptoms and exposure to an allergy-causing substance (allergen). If an immediate-type allergy is suspected, a skin prick test, blood test or oral food challenge can help to confirm the diagnosis. The decision to carry out allergy testing requires careful thought, since interpretation of these tests is not straight-forward.These tests are <strong>not</strong> useful for delayed-type reactions or intolerances.</p><p> Diagnosis of delayed-type reactions varies depending on the condition, but a useful way to investigate these is simply to carefully avoid the substance for a period of time and then re-introduce it and see if symptoms return</p>

<summary class="section-subheading">Bedwetting</summary>
<details>
<summary class="qa-question">Is bedwetting a concern in a school aged child?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Bedwetting is developmentally normal in young children. Part of the reason is that our bodies produce a hormone (called ADH) that helps us retain fluids overnight, and young children often don't make enough of this hormone. Deep sleepers may also not be woken by the urge to urinate. In an otherwise healthy child, bedwetting often doesn't need any treatment until at least 6-7 years of age. A medical review should be considered at this age, particularly if the bedwetting is causing distress to the child or family.</p>
<p>Rarely, bedwetting can be associated with another medical condition. A medical review should be sought if there are any concerning daytime symptoms such as unusual frequency of urination or daytime wetting in a child that was previously dry, or if a child who was previously dry at night for at least six months has started bedwetting again.</p> 
<p>For more information read <a href="https://www.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/bedwetting-factsheet">this factsheet</a> from the Sydney Children's Hospital Network.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
          
<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">How is bedwetting usually treated?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>If bedwetting is associated with another medical condition, such as constipation, this should be treated first. Behavioural strategies like a bedwetting alarm are highly successful as treatment for bedwetting, but they must be used consistently for several weeks. It is rare to require further treatment such as medication for uncomplicated bedwetting.</p>

<summary class="section-subheading">Constipation</summary>
<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">Why do young children get constipated?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>The most common cause of constipation in young children is 'functional' constipation, which happens in toddlers and young children who may ignore the urge to defecate and then develop anxiety after having a painful bowel movement. Continued avoidance leads to stool building up in the rectum and large bowel.</p>
<p>Investigations (e.g. blood test, X-ray) are not needed to diagnose functional constipation, but may be required if other less common medical causes of constipation are suspected. For this reason, a careful medical assessment is always recommended.</p>
    </div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">How is constipation treated?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Functional constipation is usually treated with a combination of strategies which may include diet and behaviour modification and medications such as stool softeners and laxatives. A common reason for treatment failure is stopping laxatives too early. It can take many months for the bowel to fully heal and resume normal functioning, so treatment often needs to be prolonged and tapered down gradually.</p> <p>For further information, read <a href="https://https://www.schn.health.nsw.gov.au/constipation-factsheet">this factsheet</a> from the Sydney Children's Hospital Network.</p>

<summary class="section-subheading">Eczema</summary>
<details>
<summary class="qa-question">Tips on managing eczema</summary>
<div class="qa-answer">
    <p>For children with eczema, a good rule of thumb is to keep the skin 'cool, clean and moisturised', i.e.:
<ul><li>Cool: Avoid hot baths or showers or hot itchy clothing</li>
<li>Clean: Wash daily to remove bacteria from the skin; bleach baths can be considered if needed</li>
<li>Moisturised: To prevent flares, apply moisturiser twice daily, even when skin appears healthy. Avoid products which contain:
<li>Fragrances, which may irritate the skin</li>
<li>Food substances (e.g. almond oil, coconut oil, milk, etc.), as this can increase the risk of developing of allergy to those foods, especially in infants with eczema.</li></ul></p>
</div>
</details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">Can food or vaccines trigger an eczema flare?
</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Eczema can flare in reaction to many different substances, including allergens like foods or dustmites, chemicals like chlorine or soap, and after a viral illness. Although rare, some people have reported a flare of eczema after a vaccine.</p> 
<p>It can be impractical (or impossible) to avoid certain triggers, and in some cases there are potential harms in strictly avoiding a trigger. For example, a strict restrictive diet may lead to nutritional imbalances, while avoiding vaccination increases the risk of serious infections.</p>
<p>Maintaining excellent baseline care of eczema can help to minimise flares while allowing more flexibility in diet and lifestyle</p>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">Is it safe to use steroids in eczema?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Topical steroids (i.e. ointments or creams) are safe to use in children with eczema and should not be applied "sparingly" but in ample amounts to the affected areas. They can be stopped when the skin has healed, and regular moisturisers should be continued.
Side effects are rare but are more likely with long term use of very strong steroids over large areas of skin.</p> 
<p>In recent years concerns have increased about 'topical steroid withdrawal', a condition that is not very well understood. A British dermatology expert group has released <a href="https://eczema.org/wp-content/uploads/Topical_Steroid_Topical_Withdrawal_Joint_Statement_Feb_2024.pdf">this statement</a> acknowledging that more needs to be learnt about this rare condition, but emphasising that topical steroids should continue to be used as needed.</p>

<summary class="section-subheading">Hayfever</summary>
<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">Is hayfever a significant problem in children?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Hayfever is an allergic reaction to environmental substances such as house dust mite, pollens, grasses and moulds. Symptoms include sneezing, runny nose and itchy eyes. It is also called 'allergic rhinitis'. Hayfever is uncommon under 2 years of age and gradually becomes more common, affecting about 1 in 3 adolescents.</p>
<p>The impacts of hayfever are often underrecognised. It can cause troublesome daytime symptoms, and can significantly impact sleep quality which in turn can affect daytime function, including attention and behaviour.</p>
    </div>
  </details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">How is hayfever diagnosed?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Hayfever can be diagnosed based on symptoms and examination findings. Testing is not needed to confirm the diagnosis, but can help to identify triggers, e.g. by skin prick testing.</p>

    <summary class="qa-question">What additional vaccines should I consider for my child, on top of those in the routine Australian schedule?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p><p>
    The national schedule covers at least 15 diseases, but there are some additional vaccines that you might choose to purchase to provide additional protection for your family, e.g.:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>The meningococcal B vaccine (Bexsero)</strong> is strongly recommended for all infants (and is funded for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander infants). Meningococcal infection is a rare but serious illness. The vaccine can be given on the same day as other routine vaccines.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>The national schedule includes one dose of chickenpox vaccine</strong> at 18 months of age. A second dose is recommended for all children, but must be purchased privately. The second dose is often given at 4 years of age, for convenience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>An annual flu vaccine</strong> is free for all children aged 6 months to 4 years of age, but is recommended for all children (and adults!).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Additional vaccines</strong> may be recommended based on your child's medical risk factors or your family's travel plans. These can be discussed with your GP.

<summary class="section-subheading">Reflux</summary>
<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">Why do so many babies get reflux?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) is when the contents of the stomach come back up the foodpipe (oesophagus), sometimes into the mouth. All young babies have reflux, sometimes called 'posseting' or 'spilling' when the food is spat or vomited out. This occurs since the ring of muscle that separates the foodpipe from the stomach is weak in young babies, and since they are fed lying down. Reflux naturally improves from about 4 months of age, as the ring of muscle becomes stronger, and as they start to spend more time upright. 
</p>
    </div>
  </details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">When does reflux need treatment?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
        <p>Most babies do not need any treatment for reflux, since it naturally improves over time. Treatment may be considered if there are concerning features such as signs of pain during feeding, feed refusal, poor weight gain or vomiting blood. If such features are present, the term 'gastroesophageal reflux disease' is used. Treatment options include positioning, feed thickeners and medication.

<summary class="section-subheading">Tongue Tie</summary>
<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">What is tongue tie?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>'Tongue tie' is when the tissue that connects the tongue to the bottom of the mouth, called the lingual frenulum, is too short or tight, and may limit tongue mobility. Tongue mobility is important for breastfeeding babies, since the tongue plays an important role in drawing milk from the breast. However, most babies with tongue can successfully breastfeed without any intervention
 </p>
    </div>
  </details>

<details>
    <summary class="qa-question">When does tongue tie need treatment?</summary>
    <div class="qa-answer">
      <p>Severe tongue tie can affect a baby's latch when breastfeeding. This can cause nipple pain, though it is worth noting that there are many other causes of nipple pain, most commonly incorrect positioning/latching. In rare cases, tongue tie can cause speech difficulties later in childhood.</p> <p>Severe cases of tongue tie can be managed by cutting the restrictive tissue (frenotomy). This procedure should only be considered after a careful assessment of latching by an experienced health professional.</p>
