      <summary>Allergy</summary>
      <details>
        <summary>What is the difference between a food allergy and an intolerance?</summary>
        <p>'Allergy' typically refers to reactions that occur soon (e.g. <1 hour) after ingesting a food which involve immune molecules called <strong>IgE</strong>. Symptoms vary but can include hives, lip swelling and vomiting. The most severe type of 'IgE allergy' is called anaphylaxis. 
<p>Other parts of the immune system can cause delayed reactions, sometimes called non-IgE allergies. Examples include coeliac disease and cow's milk protein "intolerance/allergy", both of which can cause delayed gastrointestinal symptoms. Non-IgE allergies do not cause immediate reactions like hives or anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Reactions that don't involve the immune system at all are not allergies and are sometimes called intolerances e.g. lactose intolerance, which occurs when there is not enough of a particular enzyme (lactase) in the gut. </p>
For more detail about different types of reactions to foods, refer to this ASCIA page.

        <summary>If my baby has mucus or blood in their nappies does that mean they have an allergy?</summary>
        <p>Small amounts of mucus in the stool in a well infant is normal. This mucus may be produced by healthy gut bacteria and may play a role in helping stool pass smoothly. 
Large amounts of mucus and/or any blood in the nappies is not normal and other causes must be considered, such as infection. Mucusy stool with fresh blood in an otherwise thriving infant is commonly due to a delayed non-IgE reaction to a food protein (often cow's milk). Other less common causes should also be considered and a thorough assessment by a GP or paediatrician is always warranted.</p>

      <summary>Reflux</summary>
      <details>
        <summary>What is infant reflux?</summary>
        <p>Infant reflux is when milk comes back up from a baby’s stomach. It's common and often improves with time.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>When should I worry about reflux?</summary>
        <p>If your baby is not gaining weight, seems in pain, or vomits forcefully, speak to your doctor.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>Constipation</summary>
      <details>
        <summary>How often should children poo?</summary>
        <p>It varies, but most children have a bowel movement every 1–3 days. Less frequent or painful stools may indicate constipation.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What can I do if my child is constipated?</summary>
        <p>Ensure a fibre-rich diet, plenty of fluids, and regular toilet time. For persistent problems, seek medical advice.</p>
